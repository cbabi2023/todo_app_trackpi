# To-Do List App with Task Prioritization
Interview Task Project.


## Features of Todo App

- Add new tasks with information like a title, description, and priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- View a list of tasks and sort them by priority.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending, with an option to view only completed or only pending tasks.
- Save tasks locally on the device, so the data stays available even if the app is closed.


## Task Creation [ Step by Step ]

1. Design a screen with a form for adding a new task.
2. The form should include three fields:
3. Title: A text field where the user can enter the task name.
4. Description: A text field for any additional details about the task.
5. Priority Level: A dropdown menu or radio buttons to select the tasks priority (High, Medium, Low).
6. Add a button to save the task. When the button is pressed, the task should appear in the main list of tasks


## Displaying the Task List:

   - Create a main screen that displays all tasks in a list format.
   - Each item in the list should show:
   - Task Title
   - Priority Level (use different colors, icons, or text to indicate priority levels: High, Medium, Low)
   - Completion Status (a checkbox or icon to show whether the task is completed or pending).
   - Arrange the list to show higher-priority tasks at the top by default.



   ## Filtering and Sorting Options:


    - Add filters to make it easier to view different types of tasks:
    - All Tasks: Show all tasks.
    - Completed Tasks: Show only tasks that have been marked as completed.
    - Pending Tasks: Show only tasks that are still pending.
    - Provide an option to sort the tasks by priority (High, Medium, Low) so users can see important tasks first
